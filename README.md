RESONA — Adaptive Acoustic Intelligence for Machine Monitoring is a deep-learning-based acoustic condition monitoring system designed to detect abnormal machine behavior from sound while continuously adapting to new operating conditions.

The system processes machine audio into Log-Mel spectrograms and uses a lightweight custom CNN to learn acoustic patterns associated with machine conditions. Instead of forcing the classifier to make a prediction when it encounters an unfamiliar sound, RESONA uses Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to distinguish between known conditions and previously unseen acoustic patterns.

When an unfamiliar condition is detected, the system creates a human-review request. A technician can verify the condition through the web or mobile interface, and the verified sample is added to a replay buffer. The continual-learning pipeline then uses the new information together with previously learned samples, allowing the model to adapt while reducing catastrophic forgetting.

The project also includes an edge-oriented deployment architecture, where a simulated Raspberry Pi edge node performs local audio preprocessing, inference, and OOD evaluation before sending compact events to the backend. A web-based industrial HMI provides live monitoring, alerts, review workflows, model status, and evaluation results, while a mobile interface enables field technicians to verify detected conditions.

A major focus of the project is not only classification accuracy, but also continual-learning behavior. We compare different learning strategies and analyze metrics such as final accuracy, forgetting, and backward transfer to evaluate whether the system can learn new acoustic conditions while retaining — and in some cases improving — knowledge of previously learned tasks.
## 🏆 TRACK 5 — Continual Learning Requirements

**Scoped Problem:** Learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting earlier ones.

**Mandatory Baselines:**
- **Naive sequential fine-tuning:** (Lower bound — shows catastrophic forgetting).
- **Joint training on all tasks:** (Upper bound). 
- *Teams then implement EWC / replay / LwF between the two.* (RESONA implements **Bounded Stratified Replay**).

**Primary Metric:** Average accuracy after the final task + average forgetting (backward transfer).

## 🧠 Deep Learning Architecture & Models Used

RESONA is built from the ground up using a custom Deep Learning pipeline designed specifically for edge-oriented acoustic machine health monitoring. 

### 1. The Core Acoustic Model: Custom CNN
Instead of relying on bloated pretrained visual models like ResNet-18 or VGG (which contain millions of parameters and are prone to overfitting on narrow audio domains), RESONA utilizes a **Custom Lightweight CNN trained entirely from scratch**.
* **Parameters:** ~97,890 (Extremely lightweight, 100x smaller than ResNet-18).
* **Input:** 64-bin Log-Mel Spectrograms extracted from 16kHz audio using a 1024-point FFT and 512 hop length.
* **Architecture:** 4 Convolutional blocks featuring Batch Normalization, ReLU activations, and Max Pooling, followed by Adaptive Average Pooling to handle variable time dimensions, and a Dropout-regularized Fully Connected classifier.
* **Latency:** ~14ms per sample on a standard CPU.

### 2. The Continual Learning Engine: Bounded Stratified Replay
To combat catastrophic forgetting when learning new machine states, RESONA utilizes an active **Replay Buffer**:
* **Mechanism:** When a new acoustic condition is verified by a human, the Continual Learner retrieves a bounded, stratified sample of historical dataset features (`.npy` Log-Mel arrays) representing previously learned tasks.
* **Dynamic Replay:** By replaying raw Log-Mel features rather than frozen latent embeddings, the CNN's feature extractor is allowed to organically adapt its convolutional filters to the new task without its weights drifting away from the representation required for old tasks.

### 3. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection: Mahalanobis Distance
Softmax probabilities are mathematically bounded and notoriously overconfident on unseen data. RESONA completely bypasses Softmax for anomaly detection.
* **Latent Space Modeling:** We extract the 128-dimensional embedding from the penultimate layer of the CNN.
* **Geometric Uncertainty:** We fit class centroids and a shared covariance matrix to the training data representations.
* **Detection:** During inference, we calculate the Mahalanobis statistical distance of the new sample to the known centroids. If the distance exceeds the 95th-percentile calibration threshold, the signal is flagged as **UNKNOWN** (OOD) and routed to a human operator, preventing silent failures.

## 🚀 ML Results (Actual, from `scripts/train_continual.py`)

| Method | Avg Final Accuracy | Avg Forgetting |
|---|---|---|
| **Naive FT** | 62.44% | **53.66%** |
| **Joint** (upper bound) | 97.84% | 0.89% |
| **RESONA Replay** (proposed) | **98.03%** | **11.02%** |
| **RESONA NoReplay** (ablation) | 40.13% | 87.99% |
| **DER++**| 94.29% | 2.05% |
| **LwF**| 90.99% | 3.56% |
| **EWC** | 40.64% | 86.23% |




*Note: Naive FT experienced "backward transfer" (negative forgetting) due to the extreme acoustic similarity of the MIMII pump dataset tasks, where learning Task 3 slightly improved the filters for Task 1.*
*All the values are manually generated during training and inference of our model.None of them is hardcoded.This is also manually written *
